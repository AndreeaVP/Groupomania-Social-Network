# Groupomania Social Network
Groupomania is an internal social network for Groupomania's employees. The goal of this tool is to facilitate more interaction between colleagues. A file with the company's logos has been provided. As well as the user requirements specifications.
The design was free of choice. 
The backend has been developed using Express. The data is stored on a SQL Database. The frontend of the app was developed with Vue.js.

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18.16.0)
- [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/) (v8.0.34)
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) (@vue/cli v5.0.8)

### Database Setup

1. Create a MySQL database for the project.

   ```env
   DB_HOST=your_database_host
   DB_USER=your_database_user
   DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
   DB_NAME=your_database_name
   ```

### Installation

2. Navigate to the `backend` directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` to start the backend server.
